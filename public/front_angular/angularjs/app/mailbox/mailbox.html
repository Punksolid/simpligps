                                        <p>Visual hierarchy is one of the most important principles behind effective web design.

                    <p>Hi Steve,</p>
                    <p>Visual hierarchy is one of the most important principles behind effective web design. We will see how you can use some very basic exercises in your own designs to put these principles into practice.</p>
                    <blockquote class="blue">
                        <p><strong>Design is a funny word. Some people think design means how it looks. But of course, if you dig deeper, it's really how it works.</strong></p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>At it's core, design is all about visual communication: To be an effective designer, you have to be able to clearly communicate your ideas to viewers or else lose their attention.</p>
